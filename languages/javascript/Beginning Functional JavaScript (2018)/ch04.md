# Chapter 4: Closures and Higher Order Functions

## Understanding Closures

### What are Closures?

Simply put, a closure is an inner function, which is just a function within another function.

```js
function outer() {
  function inner() {
    // ...
  }
}
```

The function `inner` is called a **closure function**. Closure is powerful because of its access to the scope chains (or scope levels).

Technically, the closure has access to three scopes:

1. Variables that are declared in its own declaration.
2. Access to the global variables.
3. Access to the outer function's variable (*interesting*).

### `tap` Function

The `tap` function takes a `value` and returns a function that has the closure over `value` and it will be executed.

```js
const tap = (value) =>
  (fn) => (
    typeof(fn) === 'function' && fn(value),
    console.log(value)
  )
```

> **Note:** In JavaScript, `(exp1, exp2)` means it will execute the two arguments and return the result of the second expression, which is `exp2`. In our preceding example, the syntax will call the function `fn` and also print the `value` to the console.

### `unary` Function
### `once` Function
### `memoize` Function
### `assign` Function
